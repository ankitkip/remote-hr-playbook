# Phishing Awareness (HR-Led)

Most security incidents are **human incidents**.

## Red Flags
- Urgency
- Authority pressure
- Rewards or threats
- Links asking for login/OTP

## HR Rule
No one should ever ask for:
- Passwords
- OTPs
- MFA codes
- Remote access without approval

Security is a culture issue, not just IT’s job.
